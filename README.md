# Car Brand Classification
   Deep-Learning based web application that will classify the brand of a Car.

## Data Description:
   The dataset consists of 7 selected different brands of cars. Each folder is named after a brand and contains around 500+ images of that breed. Based on the given image, we need to classify the brand as one of the 7 brands present.

#### you can download the dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitij192/cars-image-dataset

## What is the project about?
-  I created this proejct to get started with deep learning. Specially, how to classify classess using images with Deep Learning.
-  I have used the concept the transfer learning. 
-  Transfer Learning is a deep learning method, where a model developed previously for a task, is resued  as the starting point for a model on a secondary task.

### Algorithms Used:
   As mentioned earlier, I have used transfer learning in this project that is ResNet50 algorithm.

### Accuracy score:
After running the model for 50 epochs, I Have achieved :
-   Accuracy: 68.20%
-   Validation-accuracy: 65.07%   

## Issues:
-  The UI of web application need to be improved 
-  The accuracy can be increased by using custom neural networks, or by using algorithms like VGG16, InceptionV3, etc.

## Initialize the Git Repositry
     git init
     git add .
